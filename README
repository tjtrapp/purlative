Hi

I thought it would be a good idea to build this site and put it on github after reading articles about "no code, no hire" and seeing DHH's tweet about the same topic awhile back.

All of the code I've written in the past is not for open source and working at a startup left little time for me to contribute to additional projects.

Anyways, I know I can build cool stuff so lets see what I do...

Cheers.
